### Security Policy

The **Face Recognition System** project values the security of its code and data. This policy outlines the steps to report, address, and prevent security vulnerabilities:

1. **Reporting a Vulnerability**:
   - If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately by opening an issue marked as **Security** or emailing the project maintainers (email to be provided).
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, if possible.

2. **Responsible Disclosure**:
   - Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they have been addressed.
   - Give maintainers a reasonable amount of time to investigate and resolve the issue before sharing it publicly.

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Ensure that all code, especially for the API and model pipelines, is free of potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks, buffer overflows).
   - Regularly review dependencies for known security issues and apply updates when necessary.
   - Implement proper access controls for sensitive data, such as facial embeddings and user data.
   - Maintain a secure connection (SSL/TLS) for all network communications.

4. **Patch Policy**:
   - Security patches should be applied as quickly as possible once a vulnerability is confirmed.
   - All patches will undergo thorough testing to ensure no regressions or performance issues.
